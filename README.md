# Laser Piston
This datamod adds 4 piston blocks to the game:
- Laser Piston
- Sticky Laser Piston
- Interacting Laser Piston
- Sticky Interacting Laser Piston

The pistons can be toggled by interacting with them or hitting them with a laser.

Sticky pistons pull blocks even when contracting, and interacting pistons interact with the block in front of them when extending.

Right now pistons can't push more than 1 block, and they can push/pull parts of blocks such as doors and other pistons thus breaking them.
