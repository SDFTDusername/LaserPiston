# Laser Piston
This datamod adds 4 piston blocks to the game:
- Laser Piston
- Sticky Laser Piston
- Interacting Laser Piston
- Sticky Interacting Laser Piston

The pistons can be toggled by interacting with them or hitting them with a laser.

Sticky pistons pull blocks even when contracting, and interacting pistons interact with the block in front of them when extending.

Pistons can push at most 12 blocks at once.

Right now pistons can push/pull parts of blocks such as doors and other pistons thus breaking them.

# Download
Download the repository as a zip file and extract the file into the ``mods`` folder of Cosmic Reach.

# Migrate from 1.0.0
If you are going to open a world made with Laser Piston 1.0.0 in a newer version of the datamod, you should first migrate old block states to new ones.

Use the [Migrate Laser Piston](https://github.com/SDFTDusername/MigrateLaserPiston) datamod to do that, instructions are written in the README file.
